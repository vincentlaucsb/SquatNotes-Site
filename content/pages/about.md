SquatNotes was created because of the dearth of high-quality tools meant to 
take notes on videos.

## Why the name "SquatNotes"?
I was originally inspired to create this I he could take notes on exercise videos, which is one reason for the word "squat" appearing in the name.

The other was the frustration I experienced trying to name this app with something that wasn't already registered as a domain. It seemed like every single combination and permutation of the word "note" (and its related forms) and [insert common English word here] was already taken. Many of the sites were not active, but were *squatted* on by people trying to make a quick buck registering a giant swath of names in the case somebody else would find the name useful.
