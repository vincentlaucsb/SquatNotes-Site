SquatNotes' privacy policy is simple: your data stays on your hard drive. By "your data", we refer exclusively to the data that you choose to put inside your notebooks. The one exception to this is if you choose to save your notes in a folder connected to a cloud-based service, e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. In that case, your data will be subject to the privacy policy of the respective service you use.

SquatNotes, by itself, does not transmit your data to any outside servers. In fact, SquatNotes works exactly the same whether or not you are connected to the internet, except for features that obviously require internet connectivity such as downloading videos.
