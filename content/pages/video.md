SquatNotes works on MP4 and WEBM files stored on your local filesystem, so you won't waste downloading a video over and over again. MP4 and WEBM formats represent the majority of videos either downloaded from the web, or 
taken with a camera, so SquatNotes will be sure to work with your videos.

Furthermore, SquatNotes integrates with the YouTube downloader [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), so you can start take notes right away just by copy and pasting URLs.
