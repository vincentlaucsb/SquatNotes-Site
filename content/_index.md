# Information, at your fingertips
Notes aren't useful if you can't find them, yet many apps force you to organize your notes in a particular fashion.

SquatNotes provides many of the organizational features you're used to and then some:
 * Notebooks
 * Sections and subpages
 * Tags (within notebooks)
 * Links between notes (that don't get broken when you rename things)


## Own Your Notes
Your notes are stored locally, so you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/evernotes-new-privacy-policy-allows-employees-to-read-your-notes/">don't have to
worry about a nosy employee reading what you put in your personal journal</a>, and our [privacy policy](/pages/privacy) is easy to digest.

### Really own your notes
"Own your notes" wasn't just a statement about privacy, but also about the actual format your data is stored in. Throughout the short history of modern computing, many apps have come and gone and so have the proprietary file formats associated with them. Without the app that created your data, all you are left with is an incomprehensible mess of 0s and 1s.

SquatNotes primarily stores your data using human readable JavaScript Oriented Notation (JSON) files. This data format drives the modern web, and is used by almost every website you visit. For more advanced users, the usage of JSON provides an opportunity to create custom scripts for whatever desired purpose.
